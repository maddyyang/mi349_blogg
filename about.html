        <img src="IMG_6231.jpg" alt="Author Image">
        <p>Madelynn Yang is a 3rd year student at Michigan State University, majoring in Information Science & IT.</p>
        <h3>I am passionate about technology and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. My journey in IT has allowed me to explore everything from web development to data analysis, and I am always eager to learn more. When I am not immersed in tech, I enjoy staying active with Pilates, discovering new skincare routines, and spending time with friends. This blog is a space for me to share my interests, experiences, and tips on balancing student life with career growth.</h3>
